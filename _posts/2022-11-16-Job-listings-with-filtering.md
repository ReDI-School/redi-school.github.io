## 1. Introduction

Now that you've got a bit more comfortable with JavaScript, let's practice some filtering. In this challenge, you'll need to filter the job listings by the categories selected.

## 2. Project Brief 

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go
There are two options to choose from for how to approach it:

Option 1: Filter job listings based on the categories using the HTML data- attribute. In this option, you'd use the hardcoded content that already exists in the index.html file.
Option 2: Use the local data.json file to pull the data and then dynamically add the content. This would be perfect if you're looking to practice a JS library/framework like React, Vue, or Svelte.
